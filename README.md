## 🎯 What this portfolio demonstrates

This repository is the **central architecture and portfolio hub** for a practical DevOps platform built around real-world on-premises and restricted-environment operations.

The objective is not to present isolated technology tutorials. It is to demonstrate the complete engineering lifecycle:

```text
Infrastructure
      ↓
Kubernetes Cluster
      ↓
Networking / Storage / Security
      ↓
Automation / GitOps
      ↓
Observability / Logging
      ↓
Kafka / Platform Services
      ↓
Application Delivery
      ↓
Operations / Troubleshooting / Recovery
```

The implementation repositories are intentionally separated by operational domain while this repository keeps the **system-level architecture and relationships** visible.

---

## 🧑‍💻 On-Premises Kubernetes experience

The Kubernetes foundation is designed around the realities of operating clusters outside managed cloud services:

- kubeadm-based cluster bootstrap
- multi-control-plane high availability
- HAProxy Kubernetes API load balancing
- Keepalived virtual IP failover
- Ubuntu node preparation
- containerd runtime
- control-plane and worker lifecycle
- CNI networking
- NetworkPolicy enforcement
- MetalLB / bare-metal LoadBalancer capability
- ingress traffic management
- persistent storage
- Ansible-based repeatable operations
- controlled Kubernetes upgrades
- restricted and air-gapped environments
- failure testing, troubleshooting and recovery

The dedicated cluster repository presents this as an **On-Premises Kubernetes Deployment & Operations case study**, rather than simply a Kubernetes configuration collection.

## 🚀 Deployment lifecycle

```text
Physical / VM infrastructure
          ↓
Ubuntu preparation
          ↓
Containerd
          ↓
HAProxy + Keepalived
          ↓
kubeadm bootstrap
          ↓
Control-plane expansion
          ↓
Worker expansion
          ↓
Calico networking
          ↓
Storage / ingress / services
          ↓
Security policies
          ↓
Observability
          ↓
GitOps / application delivery
          ↓
Validation / failure testing
          ↓
Production operations
```

This separation is important: a production platform is not just a running Kubernetes API. It is the complete operational path around the cluster.

---

## 🌐 Networking layer

The networking domain covers:

```text
Calico
  ├── CNI
  ├── NetworkPolicy
  └── advanced networking

MetalLB
  └── bare-metal LoadBalancer

HAProxy Ingress
  └── application traffic

Kubernetes Services
  ├── ClusterIP
  ├── NodePort
  └── LoadBalancer
```

The dedicated networking repository will contain the implementation details and troubleshooting patterns.

---

## 💾 Storage layer

Persistent workloads are treated as an operational concern rather than an afterthought.

```text
Application
     ↓
PVC
     ↓
StorageClass
     ↓
Longhorn
     ↓
Persistent Data
```

The storage project will demonstrate provisioning, scheduling interactions, failure behavior and recovery considerations.

---

## 🛡️ Security layer

Security is built around explicit boundaries:

- RBAC
- least-privilege access
- namespace and workload isolation
- Pod Security controls
- NetworkPolicy
- Secret handling
- separation of production values from public source code

No production credentials, private keys, real internal addresses or sensitive infrastructure identifiers belong in these repositories.

---

## ⚙️ Automation & lifecycle

Ansible is used for repeatable infrastructure and cluster operations, while kubeadm provides explicit Kubernetes lifecycle control.

```text
Inventory
   ↓
Variables
   ↓
Roles
   ↓
Playbooks
   ↓
Node preparation / lifecycle
   ↓
Validation
```

The upgrade project will focus on controlled version changes, pre-checks, offline artifacts, sequencing and post-upgrade validation.

---

## 🔄 GitOps & application delivery

The delivery layer connects source control with Kubernetes operations:

```text
Developer
   ↓
GitLab
   ↓
CI/CD
   ↓
Container Image
   ↓
Private Registry
   ↓
GitOps Repository
   ↓
Argo CD
   ↓
Kubernetes
   ↓
Application
```

The goal is a traceable deployment path rather than a manually operated production cluster.

---

## 📊 Observability & logging

The observability domain combines metrics, dashboards and centralized logging:

```text
Applications / Nodes
        │
        ├──────────────► Prometheus ──► Grafana
        │
        └──────────────► Filebeat
                              ↓
                           Kafka
                              ↓
                          Logstash
                              ↓
                        Elasticsearch
                              ↓
                           Kibana
```

Operational troubleshooting is treated as part of the platform, including file rotation, registry state, permissions, ingestion paths and downstream indexing.

---

## 📨 Kafka platform

Kafka is a separate platform capability covering:

- KRaft architecture
- broker/controller separation
- SASL authentication
- ACL-based authorization
- service-specific identities
- client connectivity
- AKHQ administration
- replication and metadata behavior
- operational troubleshooting
- restricted-environment deployment

The objective is to demonstrate **operating Kafka as infrastructure**, not merely producing and consuming messages.

---

## 📴 Air-gapped engineering

Restricted environments are treated as a first-class design constraint.

```text
Internet-connected preparation
          ↓
Packages / images / Helm / artifacts
          ↓
Offline transfer
          ↓
Private registry / local repository
          ↓
Air-gapped cluster
          ↓
Installation / upgrade / operations
```

This approach applies across Kubernetes, container runtime, observability and Kafka components.

---

## 🧰 Helm command catalog

A separate command reference collects chart discovery, version pinning, rendering, installation, upgrades, rollback, validation and air-gapped packaging workflows across the platform. It distinguishes documented Helm deployments from components whose original chart/version or installation method still needs verification.

📘 **[Open the Portfolio-Wide Helm Command Catalog](docs/helm-command-catalog.md)**

---

## 🧯 Operational problem-solving

The portfolio will emphasize actual engineering behavior:

```text
Symptom
  ↓
Observe
  ↓
Isolate the layer
  ↓
Validate assumptions
  ↓
Change one boundary
  ↓
Re-test
  ↓
Document root cause
  ↓
Automate prevention
```

This is intentionally different from presenting only successful deployment commands.

---

## 🔐 Public repository hygiene

All public examples follow a strict sanitization model:

```text
❌ Real credentials
❌ Tokens / private keys
❌ Internal domains
❌ Real production IPs
❌ Internal registry addresses
❌ Organization-specific identifiers
❌ Private application names

✅ Generic hostnames
✅ Placeholders
✅ Fake example values
✅ Reusable architecture
✅ Sanitized operational lessons
```

---

## 🧭 Engineering principles

1. **Infrastructure first** — establish a reliable foundation before layering platform services.
2. **High availability by design** — remove avoidable single points of failure.
3. **Automation over repetition** — encode repeatable operations in Ansible and GitOps.
4. **Explicit lifecycle management** — make versions, dependencies and upgrade sequences reviewable.
5. **Layered troubleshooting** — isolate failures before changing multiple components.
6. **Offline awareness** — do not assume unrestricted internet connectivity.
7. **Operational evidence** — document validation, failure scenarios and recovery paths.
8. **Security by boundary** — keep access, traffic and configuration explicitly controlled.
9. **Portfolio modularity** — each repository demonstrates one meaningful engineering capability.
